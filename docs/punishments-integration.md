# Punishment Plugins supported

This plugin currently supports **AdvancedBan**, **LibertyBans** and **LiteBans**

Due to differences on how these plugins work, compatibility is not the same, this table shows the advantages & disadvantages of the integration.

Note: This won't work if the punishments' plugin is on proxy

游릭 Revoking Punishments may be late to be noticed (means late removal of punishment or sending the message on discord)

游리 Expired Punishments may not be noticed (means no removal messages or removal of punishments on discord)

| Plugin      	| Punishment Sync 	| Punishment Messages 	|

| AdvancedBan 	| 九덢잺游릭              	| 九덢잺游릭                  	|
| LibertyBans 	| 九덢잺游리              	| 九덢잺游리                  	|
| LiteBans    	| 九덢잺              	| 九덢잺                  	|

- It may look like AdvancedBan/Litebans is the most compatible, but I recommend LibertyBans as your punishments plugin

- I don't own litebans, I don't know what works and what doesn't, so it's not that "perfect" i just never tested it
