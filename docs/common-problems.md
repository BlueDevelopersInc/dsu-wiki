# Common Problems
the following are the problems many people have.

## / commands not showing
The Most Common Reason for this is missing bot scopes, please check your logs for a new invite generated by discordsrvutils,
and use it again and run `/dsu reload`, you can also run `/dsu debug` and check the logs part in the report, it's easier to find it there.

## /status console errors
### Reason 1
Bad Permissions, please make sure this folder `plugins/discordsrvutils/data` has permission of 777, if folder doesn't exist create it and set permission to 777
### Reason 2
Server is outdated, the default `status-online` message is not designed for old versions, of course, you can modify the default one to the one for your server version, the following should work:

```json
{
  "embed": {
    "title": ":green_circle: Online",
    "description": "Change this message in /plugins/DiscordSRVUtils/messages/status-online.json",
    "color": "green",
    "timestamp": "now",
    "footer": {
      "text": "Server is online"
    },
    "thumbnail": {
      "url": "https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/minecraft-1-logo-png-transparent.png"
    },
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "Players",
        "value": "${#server.getOnlinePlayers().length}/[server.maxPlayers]"
      },
      {
        "name": "Version",
        "value": "Unknown"
      },
      {
        "name": "Server IP",
        "value": "play.example.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Here we modified the `Players` field placeholder value from `${#server.getOnlinePlayers().size()}....` to `${#server.getOnlinePlayers().length}....`
