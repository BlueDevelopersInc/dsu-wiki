# Messages System!

DiscordSRVUtils uses a smart messages system!

# How to create/edit a message

1. Create/Edit a `.json` file in the `messages` folder. The text before the `.json` is your message name.
2. Enter your message content.
3. You can identify (send) the message in **configurations** by using `message:NAME`

!!! note 
    You can test a message using `/testmessage` and given the name of the message. You can send a message normally using `/echo` command. Use `message:NAME` if you want to send a message from the messages folder.

# Placeholders

There are infinite placeholders. This plugin's placeholders are not hard-coded. You can ask for help in [discord](https://discordsrvutils.xyz/support) if you need help finding something.

# PlaceholderAPI

If you have it installed, you can use it anywhere in the plugin. However, the messages are player-less.
